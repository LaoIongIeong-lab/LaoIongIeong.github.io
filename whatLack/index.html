<h2>What am I lacking and what do I want to learn?</h2>
<h3>What I am lacking:</h3>
<p Style="font-size:160%;">A bachelor's degree.</p>
<h3>What do I want to learn:</h3>
<h4>- Machine learning:</h4> 
   <p> Concepts such as "Machine learning solves the knowledge acquisition bottleneck problem", 
    and "Probabilistic reasoning addresses the brittleness problem", and other applications ML excels at.</p>
<h4>- Deep learning:</h4>
    <p> Transformer based genAI, Yi Ma's white box version of Transformer, and other classical architectures.</p>

<h4>- Artificial intelligence:</h4>
    <p>Apart from the <a href="../StudyNote/sicp-studynote/index.html">pie chart</a>, I am also interested in self reflection. Here are some of my questions:
    <br>
    <br>1. How do we know that we understand? 
    <br>
    <br>2. Is there an irreducibility between the evolution of the human mind, computers, and computer programs?
    <br>
    <br>3. Different domain knowledge are our different angles reflecting truth about the world. If there are so many angles, which one is better or is there a best one? 
    <br> By "better," I mean one that helps us to understand when to use which angle. Or maybe, there is no "better" angle at all?
    <br> By "best," I mean one that allows us to avoid even worrying about "which one is better?"
</p>
<h4>- Mathematics:</h4> <p>Calculus, probability theory and statistics, linear algebra, discrete maths.</p>
<h4>- General knowledge:</h4> <p>Laws, economics, business, societies, etc.</p>
<h4>- Science:</h4> <p> Physics, biology, the brain, psychology.</p>
<h4>- Core topics in computer science:</h4> <p>operating systems, networks, database, computer orgranization, etc.</p>
<h4>- English writing and reading, communication skills.</h4>
<h4>- Research methodology.</h4>
