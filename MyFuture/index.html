<h2>What do I want to do in the future?</h2>
<h3>I will prioritize contributing to Macao society; if that doesn't work out, I will contribute to the Greater Bay Area.</h3>
<p>Here are what I like to do in the future:</p>

<h4>1.Promoting human calmness or addressing inequalities.</h4>
<p>Calmness is a crucial part of health. I practice mindfulness and understand the value of being focused that I think is equivalent to calmness. Nowadays, people seem to be more anxious and depressed than ever.
    It would be really helpful to address this issue either by incorporating calming elements into technological systems or by other means.</p>
<p>It would also be beneficial to intelligently spot individuals who really are in troubles (e.g.,orphan,etc.) and to allocate social resources
    effectively.</p> 
</p>

<h4>2.To do advanced engineering.</h4>

<h4>3.To share knowledge.</h4>
<p>Education is certainly a technology. I believe anyone with average working memory can learn STEM as well as any other if they practice deliberately and follow good instructions.
</p>
<p>I do believe the trajectory of my self-learning journey is valuable for educating the next generation in STEM. 
    By self-studying a textbook called "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs", I unlearned bad habits that 
    I had developed during my time as an iOS developer. More importantly, I cultivated critical and reflective thinking 
    by independently exploring challenging problems in an iterative, feedback-driven manner. 
    The concurrency project in my <a href="../StudyNote/index.html">study notes</a> serves as a good example of first-principles thinking. </p>
