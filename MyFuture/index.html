<h2>What do I want to do in the future?</h2>
<h3>I will prioritize contributing to Macao society to achieve personal success; if that doesn't work out, I will contribute to the Greater Bay Area.</h3>
<p>Here are what I like to do in the future:</p>

<h4>- Deepen my understanding in computer science and AI.</h4>

<h4>- AI for health and mental health.</h4>
<p>Calmness is a crucial component of health. I practice mindfulness and understand the value of being focused, which I think is equivalent to calmness. Nowadays, people seem to be more anxious and depressed than ever.
    It would be truly helpful to address this issue either by incorporating calming elements into technological systems or by alternative means.</p>
<p>My envisioned strategies for promoting calmness could be categorized as follows:
    <br> 1. Prevention: This can involve building a calming environment by filtering anxious information. 
    <br> 2. Prediction: Such a system can predict early individuals who are likely to develop anxiety or depression. 
    <br> 3. Guided learning about meta-awareness: This may involve teaching mindfulness through novel human-computer 
    interactions or educational technology that can teach users to identify distraction at a meta level.
    <br> 4. Intervention: Medicine (e.g., Agarwood), or BCIs such as <a href="https://www.brainco.tech/#/">BrainCo/強腦科技</a>. </p>
<p>I believe that potential solutions may exist to address the different dimensions of mental health challenges -- 
    thereby alleviating, if not freeing us from, the inherent constraints in human affective regulation.</p>

<h4>- AI for social good.</h4>
<p>"The real problem is that we have a screwed up economic world, we have putting values on the wrong things." <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEaCuk1EhH4&t=405s">Meaning of Life 06:45</a>  --Gerald Sussman </p>
<p>In my opinion, since we are all connected to the internet, we should (be able to) help 
    minorities (e.g., orphans) who are actually in need and to reduce inequilities.</p>

<h4>- Sharing knowledge.</h4>
<p> "If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it."   ---Richard Feynman
    <br>
    As a learner, I find it a joy to try to explain something simply.
