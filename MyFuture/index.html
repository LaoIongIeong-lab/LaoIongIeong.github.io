<h2>What do I want to do in the future?</h2>
<h3>I will prioritize contributing to Macao society to achieve personal success; if that doesn't work out, I will contribute to the Greater Bay Area.</h3>
<p>Here are what I like to do in the future:</p>

<h4>1. AI for health and mental health.</h4>
<p>Calmness is a crucial part of health. I practice mindfulness and understand the value of being focused, which I think is equivalent to calmness. Nowadays, people seem to be more anxious and depressed than ever.
    It would be truly helpful to address this issue either by incorporating calming elements into technological systems or by alternative means.
<p>One shallow plan for promoting calmness I envision might be a system that can classify/analyze different kinds of anxious internet content and output a tailored 
    customized "anxiety rating", potentially enabling applications​​ to inform readers before/while reading or watching. 
    For example, a headline ".. is going to replace human...." without substantial evidence will be generally rated as high.</p>
<p>A more difficult solution will be doing things like <a href="https://www.brainco.tech/#/">強腦科技</a>. I prefer non-invasive BCIs. </p>
</p>


<h4>2. AI for social good.</h4>
<p>"The real problem is that we have a screwed up economic world, we have putting values on the wrong things." <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEaCuk1EhH4&t=405s">Meaning of Life 06:45</a>  --Gerald Sussman </p>
<p>In my opinion, since we are all connected to the internet, we should help 
    minorities (e.g., orphans) who are actually in need and to reduce inequilities.</p>

<h4>3. Advanced AI engineering.</h4>

<h4>4. Sharing knowledge.</h4>
<p> "If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it."   ---Richard Feynman
    <br>
    As a learner, I find it a joy to try to explain something simply.
