<h2>What do I want to do in the future?</h2>
<h3>I will prioritize contributing to Macao society to achieve personal success; if that doesn't work out, I will contribute to the Greater Bay Area.</h3>
<p>Here are what I like to do in the future:</p>

<h4>1. AI for health and mental health.</h4>
<p>Calmness is a crucial part of health. I practice mindfulness and understand the value of being focused, which I think is equivalent to calmness. Nowadays, people seem to be more anxious and depressed than ever.
    It would be truely helpful to address this issue either by incorporating calming elements into technological systems or by alternative means.
</p>


<h4>2. AI for social good.</h4>
<p>We are all connected to the internet. It would be beneficial to reach minorities (e.g., orphan, etc.) who are actually in trouble and reduce inequalities.</p>


<h4>3. To do advanced engineering.</h4>

<h4>4. Sharing knowledge.</h4>
<p> "If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it."   ---Richard Feynman
    <br>
    To me, it is a joy to explain something simply.
