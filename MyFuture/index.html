<h2>What do I want to do in the future?</h2>
<h3>I will prioritize contributing to Macao society; if that doesn't work out, I will contribute to the Greater Bay Area.</h3>
<p>Here are what I like to do in the future:</p>

<h4>1.Promoting human calmness or addressing inequalities.</h4>
<p>I practice mindfulness and understand the value of being focused. Nowadays, people seem to be more anxious and depressed than ever.
    <br>It would be really helpful to address this issue by incorporating calming elements into technological systems.</p>
<p>It would also be beneficial to intelligently spot individuals who really are in troubles (e.g.,orphan,etc.) and to allocate social resources
    <br>effectively.</p> 
</p>

<h4>2.To do advanced engineering.</h4>

<h4>3.To share knowledge.</h4>
<p>Education is certainly a technology. I believe anyone with average working memory can learn as well as those with 
    <br>a higher working memory if they practice deliberately and follow good instructions.
</p>
<p>I do think the trajectory of my self-learning path is valuable for the purpose of educating STEM to next generation.
    <br>To know more about my self studies, see my study notes. </p>
