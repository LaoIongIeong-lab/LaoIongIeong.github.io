<h1>Bio</h1>
<h3>2026-Future: Staying in Macau or greater bay area.<h3>
<h3>2021-2025: Self studying computer science in Macau</h3>
<p>My working experience made me realize that my lack of formal and systematic training in 
    computer science greatly limits my potential to grow further. I chose to study the famously difficult introductory book on computer science, which turned out to be the right choice (see my <a href="../StudyNote/index.html">study notes</a>).</p>
<h3>2019-2020: As an iOS architect in Beijing</h3>
<p>I took charge of app development and I successfully launched a sports news app for which 
    I served as the architect and made most of the design choices.</p>
<h3>2015-2019: As an entry level iOS developer in Beijing</h3>
<p>Building an online medical consultation platform.</p>
<h3>2013: Dropped out of University</h3>
<p> I was not as mature as I wished for, and it was not clear to me what my career path
    would be after graduating from Keele on a math degree.</p>
<h3>2011: Majored in mathematics at Keele University UK</h3>
<h3>2010: Pre-University UK</h3>
<h3>2009: Graduated from a high school in Beijng<h3>
