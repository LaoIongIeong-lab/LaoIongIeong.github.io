<h2>How can I follow the latest trend in AI?</h2>

<p>By watching videos recommended by YouTube, here are the videos and papers I found most interesting 
    <br>recently (based on their outlines, not details):</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4APMGvicmxY">Tensor Logic: The Language of AI </a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12269"> | paper</a>
<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV0CUVyHGLI">Yi Ma: Pursuing the Nature of Intelligence</a>
<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/slides/Keynote-Ma.pdf"> | powerpoint</a>

<p>I am relatively more familiar with what is called "Good Old-Fashioned AI" (see my study notes). 
    <br>At the same time, I want to learn machine learning, deep learning in order to understand
    <br> what is going on with this neurosymbolic unification and other ML methods.</p>
<p>I am also interested in self reflection:
    <br> How do we know that we understand? 
    <br> Is there an irreducibility between the evolution of the human mind, computers, and computer programs?
