<h2>How can I follow the latest trend in AI?</h2>

<p>By watching videos recommended by YouTube, here are the videos and papers I found most interesting 
    recently (based on their outlines, not details):</p>

<hr>
<p>I am relatively more familiar with what is called "Good Old-Fashioned AI" (see my <a href="../StudyNote/index.html">study notes</a>). 
    At the same time, I want to learn machine learning (e.g., "Machine learning is to solve knowledge acquisition bottleneck problem", 
    "Probabilistic reasoning is to solve the brittleness problem")
    and deep learning in order to understand 
    what is going on with this neurosymbolic unification and other ML methods and other directions.</p>
<p>I am also interested in self reflection, here are some of my questions:
    <br>
    <br>1.How do we know that we understand? 
    <br>
    <br>2.Is there an irreducibility between the evolution of the human mind, computers, and computer programs?
    <br>
    <br>3.Different domain knowledge are our different angles reflecting truth about the world. If there are so many angles, which one is better? 
    By "better" I mean, one that allows us to know when to use which angle. Or maybe, there is no "better" angle at all?
