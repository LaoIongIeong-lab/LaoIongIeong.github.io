<h2>How can I follow the trend in AI?</h2>

<p>By watching videos recommended by YouTube, here are the videos and papers I found most interesting 
    recently (based on their outlines, not details):</p>

<h4>Tensor Logic: The Language of AI</h4>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4APMGvicmxY">video</a>
<br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12269">paper</a>
<h4>Yi Ma: Pursuing the Nature of Intelligence</h4>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV0CUVyHGLI">video</a>
<br>
<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/slides/Keynote-Ma.pdf">  powerpoint</a>
<h4>Why Neural Networks Can Discover Symbolic Structures
</h4>

<h4>No Free Lunch: Fundamental Limits of Learning Non-Hallucinating Generative Models</h4>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVJ59vIden0&t=21707s">video</a>
<br>
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=-T9eX0kAAAAJ&citation_for_view=-T9eX0kAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC"> paper</a>
<h4>Position: Categorical Deep Learning is an Algebraic Theory of All Architectures</h4>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rie-9AEhYdY&t=3930s">video</a>
<br>
<a href="../TrendAI/categoricalDeepLearning.pdf" target="_blank" title="Read PDF">paper</a>
<p>What I find particularly intriguing is how category theory serves as an exceptional tool for thought, 
    especially through its connection to functional programming. My questions on self-reflection can be found on the page "What am I lacking and what do I want to learn?"/Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>An exercise related to Euclidean ring can be found in my study notes for chapters1-3, in "transcript2.5".</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p>Note that my perspective on trends is likely to be biased, as I approach them from a functional programming standpoint.
     However, I am open to different ideas to further expand my mind.
