<h2>How can I follow the latest trend in AI?</h2>

<p>By watching videos recommended by YouTube, here are the videos and papers I found most interesting 
    recently (based on their outlines, not details):</p>

<hr>
<p>I am relatively more familiar with what is called "Good Old-Fashioned AI" (see my <a href="../StudyNote/index.html">study notes</a>). 
    At the same time, I want to learn machine learning--for example, concepts such as "Machine learning solves the knowledge acquisition bottleneck problem", 
    and "Probabilistic reasoning addresses the brittleness problem"--
    as well as deep learning, in order to understand 
    current developments in neurosymbolic integration and other ML methods and directions.</p>
<p>I am also interested in self reflection, here are some of my questions:
    <br>
    <br>1. How do we know that we understand? 
    <br>
    <br>2. Is there an irreducibility between the evolution of the human mind, computers, and computer programs?
    <br>
    <br>3. Different domain knowledge are our different angles reflecting truth about the world. If there are so many angles, which one is better or is there a best one? 
    <br> By "better," I mean one that helps us to understand when to use which angle. Or maybe, there is no "better" angle at all?
    <br> By "best," I mean one that allows us to avoid even worrying about "which one is better?"
